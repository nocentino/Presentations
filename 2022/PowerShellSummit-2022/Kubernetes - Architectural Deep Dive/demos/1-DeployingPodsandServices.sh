#Deploying resources imperatively in your cluster.
#kubectl create deployment, creates a Deployment with one replica in it.
#This is pulling a simple hello-world app container image from Google's container registry.
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0


#But let's deploy a single "bare" pod that's not managed by a controller...
kubectl run hello-world-pod --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0


#Let's see of the Deployment creates a single replica and also see if that bare pod is created. 
#You should have two pods here...
# - the one managed by our controller has a the pod template hash in it's name and a unique identifier
# - the bare pod
kubectl get pods
kubectl get pods -o wide


#Remember, k8s is a container orchestrator and it's starting up containers on Nodes.
#Open a second terminal and ssh into the node that hello-world pod is running on.
ssh aen@c1-node[XX]


#When containerd is your container runtime, use crictl to get a listing of the containers running
#Check out this for more details https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/crictl

#Back on c1-cp1, we can pull the logs from the container. Which is going to be anything written to stdout. 
#Maybe something went wrong inside our app and our pod won't start. This is useful for troubleshooting.

#We can use this to launch any process as long as the executable/binary is in the container.

#Remember that first kubectl create deployment we executed, it created a deployment for us.
#Let's look more closely at that deployment
#Deployments are made of ReplicaSets and ReplicaSets create Pods!
kubectl get deployment hello-world
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl get pods


#Let's take a closer look at our Deployment and it's Pods.
#Name, Replicas, and Events. In Events, notice how the ReplicaSet is created by the deployment.
#Deployments are made of ReplicaSets!
kubectl describe deployment hello-world | more


#The ReplicaSet creates the Pods...check out...Name, Controlled By, Replicas, Pod Template, and Events.
#In Events, notice how the ReplicaSet create the Pods
kubectl describe replicaset hello-world | more


#Check out the Name, Node, Status, Controlled By, IPs, Containers, and Events.
#In Events, notice how the Pod is scheduled, the container image is pulled, 
#and then the container is created and then started.

#Expose the Deployment as a Service. This will create a Service for the Deployment
#We are exposing our Service on port 80, connecting to an application running on 8080 in our pod.
#Port: Internal Cluster Port, the Service's port. You will point cluster resources here.
#TargetPort: The Pod's Service Port, your application. That one we defined when we started the pods.

#Let's remove everything we created imperatively and start over using a declarative model
#Deleting the deployment will delete the replicaset and then the pods
#We have to delete the bare pod manually since it's not managed by a contorller.

#Deploying resources declaratively in your cluster.
#We can use apply to create our resources from yaml.
#We could write the yaml by hand...but we can use dry-run=client to build it for us
#This can be used a a template for move complex deployments.
